## UV + Packages
- Package: Code written by someone else stored into a repository 
- Different projects will use different packages
- UV is a tool we can use to create virtual environments
- VE- The environment in which codes run, all the codes you run will run in this one environment 
- Virtual environment = Python version + Packages installed, this is key for reproducing environments on other machines
- Pip is a package manager- helps you install code written by someone else
- `uv pip list` shows all packages installed in your environment 
- `uv pip install [package name]`  installs packages from pypi (where people publish their packages)
- `uv venv` - creates an environment for you to start installing packages
- Always create a virtual environment when you start a new project
- `source .venv/bin/activate` to activate virtual environment
- when you locally import, can only import from the same level or below
- create .pth file in the site packages folder found in the virtual environment, and it is used to store paths where python looks for importing code.
